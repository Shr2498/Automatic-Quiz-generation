## Testing
### Set up a virtual environment
I use `.venv` in this example, but you could call it anything else.
```sh
pip -m venv .venv
```
and then you'd need to activate it:
```sh
.venv/bin/activate
```
(Note: On windows you need to run the `Activate.ps1` file instead)

### Install dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the tests
```sh
pytest
```
